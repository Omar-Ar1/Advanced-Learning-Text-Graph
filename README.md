# NLP and Graph-Based Machine Learning Projects

These projects are part of an advanced exploration into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Graph-Based Machine Learning** techniques. They have been developed as a part of coursework and research at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (MVA), providing hands-on experience with a range of machine learning models and methodologies. The repository covers fundamental and advanced topics, including graph-based text mining, word embeddings, deep learning for NLP, graph neural networks, and network architecture search. Each project focuses on the implementation, analysis, and evaluation of key algorithms, helping to understand the theoretical foundations while gaining practical skills in applying these techniques to real-world data.
